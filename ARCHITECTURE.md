So, how does this thing work?Hey there! This doc gives you a quick, behind-the-scenes look at how we built the B2B Tender Management Platform. Let's dive in!1. The API (The Brains of the Operation)Our backend is an Express.js app that handles all the heavy lifting. We set it up as a RESTful API, which is just a fancy way of saying it's organized neatly. We split everything into different routes to keep things from getting messy./api/auth: This is your front door! It handles everything to do with getting you signed up and logged in./api/companies: Once you're in, this is where you can mess with your company's profile. You can check out your info, update it, and even upload a sweet new logo./api/tenders: This is the heart of the platform. It's where you can create new tenders, see all the public ones, or just look at the list of tenders you've posted yourself./api/search: Pretty straightforward! This is a public search bar for finding other cool companies on the platform.We also use a tool called Zod to double-check any info you send us. It just makes sure everything is in the right format before we do anything with it!2. How We Keep Your Account Safe (The Login Flow)Getting you logged in securely is super important, and here's the play-by-play on how we handle it:You Sign Up or Log In: First things first, you either create a new account or log in with your email and password.The Server Gives You a "Key": If your details are correct, our server sends back a special, temporary key called a JWT (JSON Web Token). Think of it like a digital ticket that proves you are who you say you are. It's got your user and company ID tucked inside and is set to expire after a day.Your Browser Holds the Key: Our frontend app grabs this key and saves it in your browser's localStorage.Showing Your Key for Protected Stuff: Now, whenever you try to do something that requires you to be logged in (like creating a tender), your browser automatically shows the server your special key.The Server Checks Your Key: Our backend has a bouncer (we call it authMiddleware) that checks this key on every request. It makes sure the key is legit and hasn't expired. If everything looks good, it lets you in!3. Handling Company LogosWhat about company logos? We didn't want to clog up our main database with big image files, so we came up with a neat solution using Supabase Storage.You Pick a File: On your profile page, you choose a new logo to upload.The Backend Catches It: Your browser sends the image file over to our backend. We use a helper called multer to catch the file and hold onto it for a second.Off to Supabase!: We then immediately send the image file over to a special storage bucket we set up in Supabase. It's built to handle files way better than our database can.Supabase Gives Us a Link: Once the image is safely stored, Supabase gives us a public link to it.We Save the Link: Finally, we take that new link and save it to your company's profile in our main database. That way, we can easily find and display your logo without ever having to store the actual image ourselves. Pretty cool, right?!
